# Syntopextract
This repository provides an end-to-end Python pipeline for synset-based topic modeling on agricultural domain reports. It demonstrates how to extract, preprocess, and semantically unify text from government publications, then generate interpretable topics using WordNet-based synsets (semantic concepts) rather than mere word forms.

Data Source: 24 detailed reports for grants (DDG) PDF reports from DARE, Ministry of Agriculture, India.

Domain: Agricultural R&D, policy, and expenditure in India.

Goal: Reveal coherent topics in the corpus by grouping synonyms and disambiguating polysemy using WordNet.
